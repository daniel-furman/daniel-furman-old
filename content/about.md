## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

A challenge-driven data scientist primarily focused on predictive analytics with statistics and machine learning.

My professional experience is mainly in Python and R and spans the data science stack from data mining to algorithm development.

In my free time I enjoy surfing, spending time outdoors, working out/eating healthy, and building things.

## Building Things:

- OSS Development for Data Science and Machine Learning (Github/Kaggle)
- Computer Vision and ML for Surf Prediction (app in development)

## Academic Research Interests:

- Geospatial Machine Learning for Ecological Systems, Harvey Mudd College.
- Ice Flow Physics, Upenn Experimental Geophysics Lab.
