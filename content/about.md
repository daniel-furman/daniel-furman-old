## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

A challenge-driven data scientist primarily focused on predictive modeling and machine learning.

My professional experience is mainly in Python and R and spans the data science stack from  data mining to machine learning to algorithm development.

In my free time I enjoy surfing, spending time outdoors, staying fit, eating sustainably, and reading avidly.

## Building:

- Computer Vision & ML Surf Prediction App (under development) - Full-stack
- OSS Development for Kaggle Data Science Competitions - Python and R

## Research Interests:

- Geospatial Machine Learning for Ecological Systems, Harvey Mudd College.
- Ice Physics Modeling and Experimentation, UPenn Ice Physics Lab.
