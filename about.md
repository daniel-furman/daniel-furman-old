## About Me

---

A challenge-driven learner passionate about data science, software development, and computer vision studying Information Management and Systems at UC Berkeley ('23).

I studied environmental science and mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania (May '20) earning honors and research distinctions as well as graduating Magna Cum Laude.

Ethos: “More data beats better models, better data beats more data, and eighty percent of the outcomes result from twenty percent of the inputs.”
