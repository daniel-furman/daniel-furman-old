## Will the 21st century see the restoration and rewilding of our forests? A context for conservation and sustainability:

I detail my takeaways from a summer internship with Wildlife Works Inc., where I had the opportunity to work on REDD+ feasibility.

While important to many, a lack of buy-in to sustainability solutions may be the largest barrier to effectively mitigating the worst impacts of climate change in the 21 century; however, innovative solutions to the climate crisis are seemingly everywhere. 

Triple bottom line economics (social + env + financial accounting), for example, is an exciting framework for modern conservation investments - such as REDD+ (Reforestation Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) carbon credit projects in the developing world (see [Wildlife Works](https://www.wildlifeworks.com/)). REDD+ projects are a flavor of sustainable land use initiatives, aiming to convert unsustainable forest management, such as the  development of palm oil plantations, to socially and economically viable conservation initiatives. In the summer of 2017, I was fortunate to work in this space, helping assess the feasibility for a REDD+ project in Indonesia as a field intern for Wildlife Works Inc.

Wildlife Works places an emphasis on the upliftment of marginalized communities in their investments, for reasons beyond general ESG responsibility. More often than not, remote, developing nation populations are outright owned by the resource-extraction industry, the player largely responsible degrading forests beyond restoration capacity. Without socio-economic support many others in these communities turn to poaching and illegal logging to make ends meet - an obvious problem for REDD+ projects. Therefore, done right, REDD+ places an emphasis on providing socio-economic support for the rainforest communities so to best protect the projectâ€™s flora and fauna. 

In general, sustainable land use could impart an extreme amount of greenhouse gas reduction by 2050, particularly in the tropics. According to the <in>Project Drawdown</ins> study, rapid shift to sustainable land may save 60 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions over the next three decades. For reference, the global footprint from fossil fuels was a mere 9.79 gigatons in 2014. According to *Drawdown's* scientists, global conversion to onshore wind energy imparts the most impactful mitigation in the first half of the 21 century, one of the only areas beating out sustainable land use in terms of its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Wind power possibly returns $6.17 trillion in profit with a reduction of 84.6 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (over 300,000 turbines today produce around 4 percent of electricity globally).

REDD+ projects are vital to protect tropical rainforests and their human communities. This realization sustains my fair share of climate and eco hope amidst the deluge of despairing news in America today relating, in one way or another, to climate change.
