## Will the 21st century see the restoration and rewilding of our forests? A context for conservation and sustainability:

I detail my takeaways from a summer internship with Wildlife Works Inc., where I had the opportunity to work on REDD+ feasibility.

While important to many, a lack of buy-in to sustainability solutions may be our largest barrier to mitigating climate change. Nevertheless, innovative solutions to the climate crisis are seemingly everywhere. The framework of triple bottom line economics, for example, is an exciting platform for modern conservation investments - such as a selection of REDD+ carbon credit projects promoting sustainability and reforestation in Africa and beyond (see [Wildlife Works](https://www.wildlifeworks.com/)).

Sustainable land use could impart a large amount of greenhouse gas reduction in the coming decades, particularly in the tropics. According to the <in>Project Drawdown</ins> study, sustainable land use in the tropics saves 60 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  For reference, the global footprint from fossil fuels was only 9.79 gigatons in 2014. According to *Drawdown*, global conversion to onshore wind energy imparts the most impactful mitigation in the first half of the 21 century, returning $6.17 trillion in profit with a reduction of 84.6 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (over 300,000 turbines today produce around 4 percent of electricity globally).

REDD+ projects (Reforestation Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) are a flavor of sustainable land use initiatives, aiming to convert unsustainable forest management, such as the  development of palm oil plantations, to socially and economically viable conservation initiatives. In the summer of 2017, I was fortunate to work in this space, helping assess the feasibility for a REDD+ project in East Kalimantan, Indonesia as a field intern for Wildlife Works.

Wildlife Works places an emphasis on the upliftment of marginalized communities in developing nations. More often than not, these types of remote populations are owned by the resource-extraction industry, responsible for degrading our forests beyond the capacity to restore. The project I worked on was also aimed to conserve particular flora and fauna in the area, such as orangutans. Other endangered species included many extremely vulnerable IUCN-designated species. Moreover, we found that there were 295 endemic trees in the project accounting area alone.  

It became more and more evident that REDD+ projects are vital to tropical rainforests across the world. This realization sustains, personally, a fair share of hope amidst the deluge of misinformation and manipulation in America today relating, in one way or another, to climate change.
