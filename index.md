### Species Conservation through Geospatial ML Frameworks (Harvey Mudd DS REU '19)

*Research Question* : How will climate change shift geographic overlap between symbiotic species in southwestern desert ecosystems?

*Overview* : Ecological models for effective biodiversity conservation in the Mojave. Funded through NSF Award #1757952, a collaboration with Stephen Adolph and Harvey Mudd College. Conference Proceedings: SICB Meeting '21, SCCUR Meeting '19. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15nZUMuGLiINuhSuP6DJ6hg27YKZxeC9A?usp=sharing">Written Outputs</a>.

### The Material Science of Ice Densificaiton in Nature (UPenn Experimental Geophysics Laboratory, Undergrad Senior Thesis)

*Research Question* : How does grain size, strain state, and microstructure influence the rheological behavior of ice compaction among glaciers and ice sheets?

*Overview* : Three-year geophysics project funded by UPenn's Rose Undergraduate Research Award, CURF Sustainability Action Grant, and Hayden Scholars Grant. This work was a collaboration with Prof. David Goldsby and the University of Pennsylvania's Ice Physics Lab.

**Fig. 3. <ins><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/daniel-furman/Furman-and-Goldsby/blob/master/exp_confidence_intervals.py">Flow Rates</a></ins>**. The data points represent laboratory densification rates for ice compaction at the steady state (aka, the final results of three-years worth of lab testing). The experiments were conducted across different grain sizes, revealing the influence of grain size on the rate.

Rate modeling for ice creep during densification at 233 K, a common terrestrial ice sheet temperatures. We developped the semi-empirical rate model above, with newly applied power law relationship between rate and grain size constrained with our above experimental results.
